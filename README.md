# movielens_recommendation

Recommendation Engine is fancy thing out today. It is a digital assistant which helps people to make a choice. Although choices 
change everytime in this fast moving world but this assistant is that smart, it will adapt your choice ASAP.

Recommendation Types:
1. Content Based
2. Collaborative Filtering
3. Hybrid Recommendation

We have discussed only Collaborative filtering. For both memory and model based collaborative filtering we need ratings data from user. But in hybrid recommendation system we can cold start with the problem. 

Ideas for further work:

We can use find rating difference with average function  of numpy where weights can also be assigned. As time goes mostly choices of a person changes so giving more weights to recent features might become helpful in better recommendation.

I specially want to thank "Agnes Johannsdottir".
