# movielens_recommendation

Recommendation Engine is fancy thing out today. It is a digital assistant which helps people to make a choice. Although choices 
change everytime in this fast moving world but this assistant is that smart, it will adapt your choice ASAP.

Recommendation Types:
1. Content Based
2. Collaborative Filtering
3. Hybrid Recommendation

We have discussed only Collaborative filtering. For both memory and model based collaborative filtering we need ratings data from user. But
in hybrid recommendation system we can cold start with the problem. 

I specially want to thank "Agnes Johannsdottir".
